# Description

This should be a detailed description of the background and context of your plugin,
how it's meant to be used, and perhaps some brief examples.

If you have videos or screenshots of your plugin in action, you should include them
here as well, to make them front and center for new users. Wherever possible, you
should use absolute links to these assets, so that we can easily display them 
on the hub.

# Who is This For?

This section should describe the target audience for this plugin (what knowledge,
skills and experience are assumed), as well as a description of the types of data
supported by this plugin.

Try to make the data description as explicit as possible, so that users know the
format your plugin expects. This applies both to reader plugins reading file formats
and to function/dock widget plugins accepting layers and/or layer data.

If you know of researchers, groups or labs using your plugin, or if it has been cited
anywhere, feel free to also include this information here.

# How to Guide

This section should go through step-by-step examples of how your plugin should be used.
Where your plugin provides multiple dock widgets or functions, you should split these
out into separate subsections for easy browsing. Include screenshots and videos
wherever possible to elucidate your descriptions. 

Ideally, this section should start with minimal examples for those who just want a
quick overview of the plugin's functionality, but this is also a good place to put
more complex and in-depth tutorials highlighting any intricacies of your plugin.

# Preparing for Installation (optional)

Most plugins can be installed out-of-the-box by just specifying the package requirements
over in `setup.cfg`. However, if your plugin has any more complex dependencies, or 
requires any additional preparation before installation, you should add this information
here.

# Getting Help

This section should point users to your preferred support tools, whether this be raising
an issue on GitHub, asking a question on image.sc, or using some other method of contact.
If you distinguish between usage support and bug/feature support, you should state that
here.

# How to Cite

Many plugins may be used in the course of published (or publishable) research, as well as
during conference talks and other public facing events. If you'd like to be cited in
a particular format, or have a DOI you'd like used, you should provide that information here.
